# Ecommerce Website
The project involved building an ecommerce website whose database had the following basic database operations implemented:
creating, reading, updating, deleting.
Several types of users can access the database, for example, online customers can shop and place their orders online, customer service staff has a lookup application to check inventory both locally and at nearby stores, call center staff has an application that allows quick access to customer data and the ability to quickly enter phone orders,the stocking clerks at the warehouses have an application to help them record incoming deliveries and update inventory.
This application was hosted on an online server using ngrok
